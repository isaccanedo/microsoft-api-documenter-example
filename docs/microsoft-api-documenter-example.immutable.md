## immutable() function

Function to make the provided constructor immutable

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function immutable(constructor: Function): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  constructor | Function | class definition to make immutable |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

This method is ment to be used as decorator. When this function is executed, it will freeze both the constructor and its prototype meaning that the bject can no longer be changed. Freezing an object prevents new properties from being added to it, existing properties from being removed, prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties, and prevents the values of existing properties from being changed.

## Example


```typescript
\@immutable
class BugReport {
  title: string;

  constructor(t: string) {
    this.title = t
  }
}
```
